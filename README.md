# Nixos, nix-darwin, and home-manager dot files

Here are all my configuration files for my nixos desktop (beethoven),
my macbook pro (stravinsky),  and various nix vms. It's all flake-based, using
home manager for all the user-level config and nixos and darwin to manage the 
systems (as much as possible). It even handles all my homebrew packages on my 
mac.
